# toolstack
docker toolstack for portainer

This one does not need any ENV!

There is a libretranslate -cuda version if you have an NVIDIA GPU and want more performance... IF you use proxmox, remember to passthrough the GPU to the VM first!

You have to have portainer installed

1. Copy the yaml to your stack editor, done!
